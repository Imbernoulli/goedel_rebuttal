`Goedel-Pset-v1-solved` is the largest open-source dataset of Lean 4 statements, consisting of 1.73 million formalized statements.

`Goedel-Pset-v1-solved` is generated with our Goedel-Prover on the largest Lean4 statement set Goedel-Pset-v1. We keep two correct answers for each problem and also include mathlib. Using this dataset, we train our Goedel-Prover-SFT with simple supervised fine-tuning which achieves the SOTA performance 57% on miniF2F.

`Lean-workbook-proofs` is the 29.7 solutions of Lean-workbook found by Goedel-Prover-SFT.
